This is a repo of my lab work and assignments for the Parallel and Distributed Computing class taught at the University of Science and Technology, Zewail City, Fall 2019.

The course covers a broad range of topics related to parallel and distributed computing, including parallel and distributed architectures and systems, parallel and distributed programming paradigms, parallel algorithms, and scientific and other applications of parallel and distributed computing.

I am sharing my work as a way to share knowledge and help people who are interested in HPC and parallelization. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
